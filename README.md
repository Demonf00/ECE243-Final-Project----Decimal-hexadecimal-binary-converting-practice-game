# ECE243-Final-Project----Decimal-hexadecimal-binary-converting-practice-game
Decimal/hexadecimal/binary converting practice game:  There are many levels of the game. At first level, one number(decimal/hexadecimal/binary) would appear on the screen, and the player should type in the asked type of the number(decimal/hexadecimal/binary). If the answer is correct, the player would get points. If the answer is wrong, the correct answer would be shown on the screen. As the game level goes up, the number of questions on the screen would increase/ the time for answering each level is reduced, and the player can get more points. The total points the player got would be shown on the screen at last.
